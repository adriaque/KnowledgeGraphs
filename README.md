Knowledge Graph Project

This project contains a combined knowledge graph created from ChEBI and reactome databases. The data is represented using the RDF (Resource Description Framework) data model and is stored in a triplestore database.

Installation

To use this project, you need to install the following software:

Apache Jena Fuseki
Apache Jena
Eclipse
Java


Usage

To access the data in the knowledge graph, you can use the SPARQL query language. The SPARQL endpoint is available at http://localhost:3030/#/. You can use a web interface such as FUSEKI to execute queries or use a the public FUSEKI server prodrovided by the author in http://16.170.209.72:3030 (if it's not opened contact by mail).



The following data sources were used to create the knowledge graph:

-Reactome: a free and open-source curated database that provides a comprehensive and interconnected view of molecular events underlying biological pathways and processes.

-ChEBI:is a freely available dictionary of molecular entities, including small molecules, ions, and peptides, which have been manually curated and annotated with chemical, biological, and structural information.
